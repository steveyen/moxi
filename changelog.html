<h2>Changes from release 0.9.5 to 0.9.6</h2>
<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:eJJEEE&amp;chl=Dustin|Aliaksey|Matt|Cosimo|Steve|Trond" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release 0.9.6

Changes since 0.9.5:

* Fix for libmemcached integration.
  The library versioning for libemmcached was inadvertantly left out
  of configure.ac.  This would cause build failures on some platforms.

* Link libraries at the correct time.
  Some of the link flags were in the wrong place for libconflate.  This
  was fine for some platforms, but not others.

* Resynch with memcached upstream.
  Moxi is now resynched and tested against much of memcached 1.4.0
  upstream.

<h2>Changes from release 0.1.0 to 0.9.5</h2>
<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release 0.9.5

Changes since 0.1.0:

The changes are so numerous it's pretty much impossible to enumerate
them in any kind of useful summary.  Just to give you a feel for it

* a2b protocol proxy was completed
  memcached protocol ascii to binary protocol was completed, tests
  were added and enhanced and fixes for various OS and compiler
  platforms were added.

* Support for libconflate completed
  Support for the libconflate XMPP management agent was added.  This
  can allow for online reconfiguration of moxi.

* Many stats added
  Proxy related statistics added.

* Front cache implemented
  A small, non-coherent, controlled by timeouts and key prefixes local
  or "L1" cache was added to the proxy.

* Support for configuration files
  To support more automated deployment, moxi now allows for
  configuration via file, passed as a parameter to -z.  For example,
  this allows for an /etc/moxi.conf to be used by a sysv style init
  script.
